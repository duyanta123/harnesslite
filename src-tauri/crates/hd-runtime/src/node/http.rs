//! The one HTTPS client in this crate that does not go through Node.
//!
//! Every other network call the shell makes runs inside the harness's own Node
//! process and borrows its `fetch`, which means requests inherit the proxy
//! settings and certificate store the user's Node already works with, for
//! free. That is a deliberate trade and a good one, with exactly one blind
//! spot, and this file exists to cover it: on the machine that has no Node,
//! there is no Node to fetch Node with.
