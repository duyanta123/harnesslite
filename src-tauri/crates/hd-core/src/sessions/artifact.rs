//! One session's bytes, however the harness happened to write them.
//!
//! A session log is JSONL, and by default it is compressed: one Zstandard frame
//! holding the header line, then one frame per batch of events appended after
//! it. Reading it back is therefore not "decompress a file" but "decode frames
//! until they run out" — and running out early is normal. A session being
//! written right now ends in a frame that is not finished, and the harness
//! treats such a tail as not yet committed. So does this: the committed prefix
//! is the whole of what either reader sees.
//!
//! Decompression is pure Rust and one direction only. Nothing here writes a
//! session log, and nothing ever should — the harness appends to these files
//! while the app is running, and a second writer is how a conversation gets a
//! hole in it.
