//! Every session the harness has ever run on this machine, read back.
//!
//! The harness keeps each conversation as an append-only log under its own home
//! (`$DSH_HOME`, else `~/.dsh`), one directory per project and one below that
//! per session. It can index those logs for search — the machinery ships with
//! it — but the shipped configuration points that index at an in-memory
//! database it never opens, so nothing is indexed and nothing older than the
//! running session can be found again. Its web UI has no address for a session
//! either: there is no link that opens one.
//!
//! So a conversation from last week exists, in full, and is unreachable. Closing
//! that is work a shell is unusually well placed to do — reading every log on
//! the disk and folding it down is a background job with no interface, which is
//! exactly what a native process is for and exactly what a page cannot be asked
//! to do while somebody is waiting on it.
//!
//! Nothing here writes. The harness appends to these files while this app is
//! running, and a second writer on an append-only log is how a conversation gets
//! a hole in it.
//!
//! The whole domain is synchronous: no threads are spawned and no async runtime
//! is assumed. A cold first scan of a year of logs is seconds of decompression,
//! so the shell layer is expected to run roster, search, transcript and export
//! calls on a blocking thread (`spawn_blocking`) rather than on the UI's reactor.
