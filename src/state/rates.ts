/**
 * What the user pays for a million tokens, per model.
 *
 * This is the one number the machine cannot find out for itself. The logs record
 * what was spent down to the token, but nothing on the disk records what that
 * costs — the price depends on a contract, a region, a discount, a prepaid
 * balance, and a public price list would be wrong for some users on the day it
 * shipped and wrong for everybody within a year. So the rate is asked for once
 * and remembered, and a model nobody has priced is reported as unpriced rather
 * than counted as free.
 *
 * The currency is a label, not a conversion. Nothing here converts between
 * currencies, because that would need a rate that changes hourly and an
 * assumption about which currency the number was typed in.
