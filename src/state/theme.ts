/**
 * Light or dark, and who decides.
 *
 * Three choices rather than two. A desktop application that only offers a
 * switch has quietly taken the decision away from the system: the user set
 * their machine to turn dark at sunset, and this one window would stop
 * following. So "system" is a real option, it is the default, and it keeps
 * tracking the preference for as long as it is the one selected.
 *
 * The choice is written to `data-theme` on the root element and nowhere else.
 * Every colour in the app is a custom property, so re-pointing them there is
 * the whole of the theme — no component knows which one it is drawing in.
 *
 * Two things hang off the same root element and belong here for that reason:
 * `data-material`, which is a fact about the window rather than a choice and so
 * is written once, and the compositor, which has to be moved by hand because
 * parts of the window frame are drawn by the system and not by this stylesheet.
