/**
 * Whether this launch has to show someone around.
 *
 * A guide, not a mode. The alternative — a simple mode and an advanced one —
 * asks a question nobody can answer before they have used the application, and
 * then makes them go and find the switch again once they can. What is actually
 * different about a first run is that nothing is installed and nothing has been
 * chosen yet, and that is a sequence rather than a preference: three steps, once,
 * and then the application they were leading up to.
 *
 * So there is no setting here and nothing to turn back on, because there is
 * nothing in the guide that is not also in the app. The checks are the console's
 * own checks, the agent picker is on the console too, and the last step is the
 * button that was always there.
