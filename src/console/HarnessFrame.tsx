/**
 * The harness UI, hosted inside this window rather than replacing it.
 *
 * The obvious implementation is to point the whole WebView at the harness once
 * it is serving. That is a trap once the shell draws its own title bar:
 * navigating away takes the chrome with it and leaves a window that cannot be
 * moved, minimised or closed. Framing it keeps the chrome ours no matter what
 * the harness page does.
 *
 * It also keeps this shell out of the harness's DOM. Reaching in to restyle
 * someone else's application is a maintenance debt that comes due on their
 * release schedule, not ours.
