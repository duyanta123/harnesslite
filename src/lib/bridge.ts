/**
 * The desktop, answered on behalf of whatever the harness is running.
 *
 * The harness UI is a frame inside this window, and a frame cannot reach Tauri:
 * capabilities are granted per webview, so opening the IPC to it would hand a
 * page every command this shell has — starting processes, removing profiles,
 * opening shells. That is not a trade worth making for four conveniences.
 *
 * So the frame gets a letterbox instead. It posts a request up, this module
 * decides whether to carry it out, and posts an answer back. Every method is
 * below, all of them readable in one sitting — which is the point.
 *
 * The trust boundary is drawn twice, because either check alone has a hole:
 *
 *   - the sender's origin has to be the origin the harness is serving on right
 *     now, which turns away a page the harness frames in from the internet;
 *   - and the sender has to be a frame of *this* window, which turns away
 *     anything that merely shares that origin — a popup, another tab.
 *
 * Nothing is served while nothing is serving, because there is no origin to
 * trust then. The client half lives in the managed integration package that
 * rides along with the harness process.
