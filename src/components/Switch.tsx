 * switch acts the moment it is thrown. Everything this one is used for writes
 * immediately, so it has to be the second one.
 *
 * The knob is the only part that changes colour, and it changes to keep contrast
 * against both track colours in both palettes — a switch nobody can see the
 * state of is a switch that gets thrown twice.
